<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
I do not read, examine or track your browser history or any other personal (or impersonal) information.  You may receive a warning that the extension has the ability to see what you're browsing, which pretty much applies to most extensions out there.

I am a strong believer in privacy and I'm not doing anything shady with the extension.  It's just a tool to help remove the distracting and click-baity elements from YouTube.

Best,
